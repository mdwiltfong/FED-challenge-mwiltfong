# Front End Developer Intern Challenge

## Quick Description:

This is my submission for Shopify's Front End Developer Intern position. The app will use React for the front end, and Express as a server. In addition, I will be using the Open AI API.

## Specifications:

- The app will send plain text prompts to the API
- The app will display the results in a list.
- The interface will include the following:
  - A form to submit the text prompts
  - Submitting the form sends the prompt to the OpenAI API
  - The Results are displayed in a list, sorted from _newest_ to _oldest_
  - Each result should contain the original prompt and a response from the API.
- Open AI's completion API must be used.
- It's recommended to use the `text-curie-001` engine.
- Any framework can be used, or none.
- The HTML must be served client-side.
- The project must also be hosted on a live site.

## Extra Features:

- It's recommended to only choose one or two extra features:
  - Save responses if the user leaves or reloads the page
  - Let the user choose the AI enginer from a selected box
  - Add some presets for the user to quickly send a good prompt
  - Make the app more specific to a single purpose.

## Submission:

- A link to the website containing the app.
- A link to the github repository.
- Any other notes to consider alongside the page.
